                <h2>What's new in version 4.4</h2>
                <p>The migration guide has a complete list of what's new in 4.4.0. We recommend you give that page a read when upgrading. A few highlights from 4.4.0 are:
                <ul>
                    <li> Simplified tests for Database package, this helps with the development of 5.x </li>
                    <li> Fixed build errors from new versions of intl, MySQL, and openssl </li>
                    <li> Improved README docs </li>
                    <li> Fixed regression in route parameter coercion introduced in 4.4.3, with the value 0 being cast to an int </li>
               
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While CakePHP 4 contains a number of breaking changes we have prepared an exhaustive migration guide
                    covering all the deprecated and removed features as well as highlighting the shiny new features.
